# FAQ

#### How do I run multiple nodes?

Multiple nodes can be ran pointing to the same wallet and email address, just follow the same instructions on each node.

#### I'm already a Filecoin storage provider, how does it work with my existing nodes, wallets, etc.?

Saturn runs independent of storage, we suggest a clean (virtual) server to run Saturn.
