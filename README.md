# Saturn Node ü™ê

Saturn node is the general implementation for L1 and L2 nodes of Saturn.
It allows retrieval clients to request CIDs and byte ranges of CIDs.
The node returns CAR files from cache or falls back to inner level nodes.

**Saturn is still in v0, but you can run a test-network node to help test Saturn today, we appreciate any and all feedback**

## Running a node

1. Install docker ([Instructions here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#server))
2. Authenticate docker with the GitHub Container Registry ([Instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry))
3. Set FIL_WALLET_ADDRESS and NODE_OPERATOR_EMAIL env variables in `.bashrc` and `/etc/environment` for auto-update
4. Run the docker image:

   **Test network:**
    ```shell
    sudo docker run --name saturn-node -it -d --restart=unless-stopped \
      -v $HOME/shared:/usr/src/app/shared \
      -e FIL_WALLET_ADDRESS=$FIL_WALLET_ADDRESS \
      -e NODE_OPERATOR_EMAIL=$NODE_OPERATOR_EMAIL \
      --network host \
      ghcr.io/filecoin-project/saturn-node:test
    ```

   **Main network (invitation only):**
    ```shell
    sudo docker run --name saturn-node -it -d --restart=unless-stopped \
      -v $HOME/shared:/usr/src/app/shared \
      -e FIL_WALLET_ADDRESS=$FIL_WALLET_ADDRESS \
      -e NODE_OPERATOR_EMAIL=$NODE_OPERATOR_EMAIL \
      --network host \
      ghcr.io/filecoin-project/saturn-node:main
    ```
    
5. Check logs with `docker logs -f saturn-node`
6. Wait for the sign up to happen with the orchestrator and the registration to DNS (this may take several minutes)
7. Download the [`update.sh`](update.sh) script

   **Test network:**
    ```shell
    wget -O $HOME/update.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/filecoin-project/saturn-node/main/update.sh
    ```

   **Main network (invitation only):**
    ```shell
    export SATURN_NETWORK=main # should also be saved in `.bashrc` and `/etc/environment`
    wget -O $HOME/update.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/filecoin-project/saturn-node/main/update.sh
    ```
8. Setup the cron to run every 5 minutes:
   ```shell
   */5 * * * * $HOME/update.sh >> $HOME/cron.log
   ```
   **Make sure to have FIL_WALLET_ADDRESS set in `/etc/environment` or hardcoded in `update.sh` for auto-update to work**


## Developing

In development, to avoid an automatic CI/CD deployment to the test network when any change is made to the `container/` directory, include `[skip ci]` in the `git commit` message. Like:

```shell
git commit -m "my commit message [skip ci]"
```

### Build

Build the docker image with 
```shell
./node build
```

### Run

Run the docker container with 
```shell
./node run
```

### Build and run

```shell
./node build run
```


## Files

#### nginx configuration

`nginx/` contains the nginx configuration of the caching proxy

#### Shim

`shim/` contains the necessary code to fetch CIDs and CAR files for nginx to cache
